The optional-silence phone SILE occupies 16.4% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 91.5% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SILE occupies 8.7% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 5.4 hours of data, or 4.5 hours if SILE frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SILE comprise 3.5% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (19,22.6,62)
