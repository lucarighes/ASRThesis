The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 24.6% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 81.1% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 7.1% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 140.0 hours of data, or 105.6 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 1.5% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (31,34.3,70)
