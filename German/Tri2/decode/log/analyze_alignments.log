The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 24.5% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 78.7% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 5.3% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 2.4 hours of data, or 1.8 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 1.5% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (20,24.4,60)
