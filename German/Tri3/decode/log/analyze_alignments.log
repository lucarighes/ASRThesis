The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 22.0% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 78.2% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 4.7% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 2.4 hours of data, or 1.8 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 1.6% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (18,20.8,52)
