The optional-silence phone SILE occupies 18.3% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 90.9% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SILE occupies 10.0% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 5.4 hours of data, or 4.4 hours if SILE frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SILE comprise 3.7% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (20,24.4,65)
