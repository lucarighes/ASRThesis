# ASRThesis

In this repository there is the implementation of the ASRs for the English and German languages.

Inside the folders it is possible to find all the configuration files, the dictionaries, the scripts for data preparation, the output files and the program to test the ASR (currently listed in the "English" folder).
There are no data used for training and data aligned due to the size.
